I’m embarking on a 120-hour water fast, and I’m here to document the entire experience! Buckle up, because it’s going to be a wild ride (hopefully without too much hanger).

**Disclaimer**: Before trying this, it’s important to consult with your doctor or other medical professional. Research thoroughly before attempting anything similar. Remember, I’m not a doctor, dietician, or nutritionist so this is not medical advice.

  Electrolytes are crucial to prevent headaches, fatigue, and muscle cramps.

## Milestones and Mindsets

I’ve been on a strict Ketogenic diet for a month with OMAD and lost 7 kgs. Now I have loose skin. After binging on fasting videos, I’ve learned how it speeds up autophagy, which might help my saggy bits and give me those sweet health gains.

Stay tuned for regular updates on how I’m feeling, both physically and mentally. Wish me luck!
