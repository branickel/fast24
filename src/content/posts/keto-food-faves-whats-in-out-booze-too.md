The Ketogenic diet, commonly known as the Keto diet, focuses on high-fat, moderate-protein, and low-carbohydrate intake to promote ketosis, a state where the body burns fat for fuel instead of glucose. Here, we provide a detailed list of allowed and disallowed foods and drinks, including alcoholic beverages, supported by scientific research.

## Allowed Foods and Drinks

### 1. Fats and Oils
- Butter and ghee
- Coconut oil
- Olive oil
- Avocado oil
- Lard and tallow
- MCT oil

#### Scientific Basis
Dietary fats are essential in a Keto diet as they help maintain ketosis by providing the primary energy source. Research indicates that replacing carbohydrates with fats can improve metabolic health (Kosinski & Jornayvaz, 2017).

### 2. Proteins
- Meat (beef, pork, lamb)
- Poultry (chicken, turkey, duck)
- Fish (salmon, trout, mackerel, sardines)
- Shellfish (shrimp, crab, lobster)
- Eggs

#### Scientific Basis
Adequate protein intake supports muscle maintenance and satiety without disrupting ketosis. Studies show that high-protein, low-carb diets can aid in weight management and metabolic health (Paoli et al., 2013).

### 3. Low-Carb Vegetables
- Leafy greens (spinach, kale, lettuce)
- Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage)
- Zucchini
- Bell peppers
- Asparagus
- Avocado
- Mushrooms

#### Scientific Basis
Low-carb vegetables provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fibre while keeping carbohydrate intake minimal. These foods help in maintaining overall health without impacting ketosis (Westman et al., 2007).

### 4. Dairy Products (Full-Fat)
- Cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, blue cheese)
- Heavy cream
- Sour cream
- Cream cheese
- Greek yogurt (unsweetened)

#### Scientific Basis
Full-fat dairy products are low in carbs and high in fats, making them suitable for Keto. They also provide calcium and other nutrients important for bone health (Gómez-Gallego et al., 2017).

### 5. Nuts and Seeds
- Almonds
- Walnuts
- Pecans
- Macadamia nuts
- Chia seeds
- Flaxseeds
- Pumpkin seeds

#### Scientific Basis
Nuts and seeds offer healthy fats, fibre, and protein, contributing to satiety and nutritional balance on a Keto diet (Forsythe et al., 2008).

### 6. Beverages
- Water (still or sparkling)
- Coffee (black or with added fat like butter or MCT oil)
- Tea (unsweetened)
- Bone broth

#### Scientific Basis
Staying hydrated with carb-free beverages is crucial. Studies suggest that coffee and tea can enhance metabolism and support overall health (Van Dam et al., 2005).

### 7. Other
- Berries (in moderation: strawberries, raspberries, blackberries)
- Coconut milk and almond milk (unsweetened)
- Dark chocolate (high cocoa content, 70% or higher)

#### Scientific Basis
Berries and dark chocolate, when consumed in moderation, provide antioxidants and fibre without significantly impacting ketosis (Basu et al., 2010).

## Disallowed Foods and Drinks

### 1. High-Carb Foods
- Grains (wheat, rice, oats, corn)
- Bread and pasta
- Cereals
- Baked goods (cakes, cookies, pastries)
- Sugar and honey
- Potatoes and sweet potatoes
- Legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas)
- Most fruits (bananas, apples, oranges, grapes)

#### Scientific Basis
High-carb foods increase blood glucose levels, disrupting ketosis and preventing fat burning. Studies show that reducing carbohydrate intake is essential for maintaining ketosis (Volek & Phinney, 2012).

### 2. Sugary Foods and Drinks
- Soda
- Fruit juices
- Candy and chocolate bars
- Ice cream
- Sweetened yogurt

#### Scientific Basis
Sugary foods and drinks can spike insulin levels and add excessive carbohydrates, impeding the body's ability to stay in ketosis (Ludwig, 2002).

### 3. Processed Foods
- Processed meats with added sugars (certain sausages, deli meats)
- Fast food items (burgers with buns, fried chicken)
- Snack foods (chips, pretzels)

#### Scientific Basis
Processed foods often contain hidden carbs and unhealthy fats that can disrupt ketosis and overall health (Monteiro et al., 2018).

### 4. Low-Fat and Fat-Free Products
- Low-fat dairy products
- Low-fat margarine and spreads
- Diet products with hidden sugars

#### Scientific Basis
Low-fat products usually compensate with added sugars and carbs, which are counterproductive in a Keto diet (Gomez-Pinilla, 2008).

### 5. Unhealthy Fats
- Margarine
- Vegetable oils (corn oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil)
- Trans fats (found in some processed foods)

#### Scientific Basis
Unhealthy fats can lead to inflammation and other health issues. It's important to focus on healthy fats that support ketosis and overall well-being (Mozaffarian et al., 2006).

### 6. Alcoholic Beverages
- Beer
- Sweetened cocktails
- Sugary mixed drinks

#### Scientific Basis
Alcoholic beverages high in carbs can disrupt ketosis. Studies suggest moderation and choosing low-carb options (Bujanda et al., 2008).

## Exploring Alcohol on a Ketogenic Diet

### Allowed Alcoholic Beverages
**Dry Wines:**
Red and white wines typically contain fewer carbs (approx. 3-4 grams per serving).

**Champagne/Sparkling Wine:**
Usually low in carbs.

**Hard Liquors:**
Whiskey, vodka, gin, tequila, rum (straight or mixed with carb-free mixers).

#### Scientific Basis
Moderate consumption of low-carb alcoholic beverages may not significantly impact ketosis. It's important to monitor intake as alcohol can affect metabolism and judgment (Gepner et al., 2015).

### Disallowed Alcoholic Beverages
**Beer:**
High in carbs, typically 10-20 grams per serving.

**Sweet Wines and Cocktails:**
Contain added sugars and high carbohydrate content.

#### Scientific Basis
High-carb alcoholic beverages can prevent the body from maintaining ketosis, disrupting the diet's effectiveness (Bujanda et al., 2008).

## Summary
The Ketogenic diet emphasizes high-fat, moderate-protein, and low-carbohydrate intake to induce ketosis. It allows for a variety of nutrient-dense foods while avoiding high-carb and sugary items. When considering alcohol, opting for low-carb choices in moderation can fit within a Keto lifestyle. Always consult with a healthcare professional before making significant dietary changes.
