GKI Ranges:

GKI < 1: High therapeutic ketosis

1 <= GKI < 3: Moderate therapeutic ketosis

3 <= GKI < 6: Low therapeutic ketosis

6 <= GKI < 9: Low level of ketosis

GKI > 9: No ketosis

The GKI (Glucose Ketone Index) Calculator is a tool used to measure the metabolic state of ketosis. Ketosis is a condition where the body primarily uses ketones, derived from fat, as a source of energy instead of glucose. The GKI Calculator is particularly useful for:

#### Monitoring Therapeutic Ketosis

It helps individuals track their level of ketosis, which can be crucial for those following a ketogenic diet for therapeutic purposes, such as managing epilepsy, certain cancers, or other metabolic conditions.

#### Optimising Ketogenic Diets

For those on a ketogenic diet for weight loss, athletic performance, or general health, the GKI Calculator provides insight into how well their body is adapting to the diet and using fats as a primary energy source.

#### Adjusting Dietary and Lifestyle Choices

By regularly checking GKI, individuals can make informed decisions about their diet and lifestyle, adjusting their carbohydrate and fat intake to achieve desired ketosis levels.

#### Medical and Nutritional Guidance

Healthcare providers and nutritionists can use GKI as a metric to guide and monitor their patients' progress and adherence to dietary protocols aimed at inducing and maintaining ketosis.

#### Overall

The GKI Calculator is a valuable tool for anyone looking to understand and optimise their metabolic state through diet and lifestyle changes.
